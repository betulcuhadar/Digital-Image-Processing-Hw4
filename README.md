# Digital Image Processing Homework 4

<br/>
This repository contains image matching and transformation using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm and affine geometric transformations. It demonstrates how to detect key points and descriptors in images, perform key point matching, estimate an affine transformation, and seamlessly combine two images.
